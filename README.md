# Javascript Quiz Game

This is a **Javascript Quiz Game** project that fetches some trivial data from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and creates a quizz. The player can start by clicking the new game button, and take the next question by clicking the next button.
MAX_SCORE can be changed in code and is flexible, but MAX_QUESTIONS  is dependent on the API URL from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
